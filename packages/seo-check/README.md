# Elder.js Plugin: SEO Check

Checks the generated HTML for more than 50 common SEO issues along with tips on fixing them.

Works in single page mode and site wide mode.

Pro users can easily use this plugin to fire off an email to the marketing/content team any time an SEO issue is encountered.

## SEO Checks

This plugin is very opinionated based on years of [Nick Reese](https://nicholasreese.com)'s experience running major SEO assets.

If you think the rules are too strict or opinionated this plugin supports adding your own rules.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @elderjs/plugin-seo-check
```

## Config

Once installed, open your `elder.config.js` and configure the plugin by adding `@elderjs/seo-check` to your plugin object.

```javascript
plugins: {
  '@elderjs/plugin-seo-check': {
    display: ['errors', 'warnings'], // what level of reporting would you like.
    handleSiteResults: async ({ meta, ...results }) => {
      // 'results' represents all of the issues found for the site wide build.
      // power users can use this async function to post the issues to an endpoint or send an email
      // so that the content or marketing team can address the issues.
      if (Object.keys(results).length > 0) {
        console.log(results);
      } else {
        console.log(`No SEO issues detected.`);
      }
    },
    preferences: [], // define your own preferences. See below.
    rules: [], // define your own rules. This overwrites existing rules. See below.
    // writeLocation: './report.json' // used to write a JSON report. Relative to the root.
  },
}
```

If things are too verbose for dev, try this:

```javascript
plugins: {
  '@elderjs/plugin-seo-check': {
    display: process.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? ['errors', 'warnings']: [], // disables reporting unless you in production building.
    },
  },

}
```

For access to the default rules and preferences:

```js
const { defaultPreferences, rules } = require('@elderjs/plugin-seo-check');
```

## Contributing:

- If you end up writing your own rules, if you want to write a how-to that would be great.
